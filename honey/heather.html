					Heather honey
				</h1>
	
				<p>
					A relatively rare and the least popular honey variety. 
					It has a distinctive light-brown colour with a reddish tint, and a jelly-like consistency. 
					It has a barely perceptible heather flavour which disappears with time, and a pleasant, slightly bitter taste.
